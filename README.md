# Simple Scrolling Game

## Brief

For this project, you'll demonstrate an understanding of drawing and animation using the HTML5 canvas element as well as an understanding of JavaScript basics.  You'll make a simple scrolling game using the HTML canvas element and  the requestAnimationFrame method of the window object.

In the game, your player character is on the left edge of the screen and moves parallel to that edge when the player presses the relevant arrow keys.   Two types of objects will scroll across the screen toward the player.  If the player comes into contact with a harm object, the number of lives remaining is reduced.   If the player comes into contact with a benefit object, the points are increased.

## Key Technologies Used
* PWA
* HTML Canvas
* JavaScript ES6

## TODO
* make objects(benefit/harmful) appear randomly
* collision
* score
* lives
* increasing difficulty
* data for each object (player, harm, benefit, game?) should be stored as JS Objects.
* how to play
* game theme w/ background image
* PWA

## ISSUES
* player shouldn't move outside boundries
* blurry canvas elements - images, text, etc


## Smaller tasks
- collision (respond to them? & allow)
- benefit objects
    - multiple of them
    - random positions
- Game Over
    - all game animations should stop when game over 
    - game over needs to be displayed in canvas environment


## DONE?
- collision w/ player
- move left
